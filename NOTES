--- 0.98.XX -----------------------------------------------------------------

- Absolute snap now can pick reference point, old snap that used center of
  selection as reference point was moved to MMB option. [Giniu]

- Added new preference: constrain axes to grid. [Scorpius]

- Added "Blue Cube" interface icons. The original icons are in the "Classic"
  bundle. Switching between icon sets is easily accomplished through the
  User Interface preference tab. [Scorpius]

- Revived the Plane Plugin, which was removed from a previous release
  because it created invalid objects. This has been fixed by adding a
  thickness parameter; thereby creating a properly closed mesh. [Scorpius]

- Added two new primitives (look under the More menu):
  Tube: generates a hollow tube or pipe with an actual wall-thickness.
  Gear: generates a very simple gear. Allows the user to specify the number
  of teeth and the tooth height. [Scorpius]

- Added two more primitives:
  Ncube: Generates a cube with an arbitrary level of subdivisions (simply
  specify the number of cuts per edge) plus a spherize option.
  Ngon: Generates a polygon with an arbitrary number of vertices. This may
  look like a single-sided polygon but, in fact, has two faces. [Scorpius]

- New GeoDome primitive. Generates a geodesic dome with an arbitrary level
  of subdivisions. Has three base objects, spherize and half-dome options.
  [Scorpius]

- New *.stl import/export plugin. Stereolithography files can be sent to
  a service bureau to create an actual plastic prototype of your model.
  [Scorpius]

- New command in tools menu: "Scene Info: Area & Volume." Calculates the
  area and volume for each object in the scene and displays the info in
  a pop-up window. [Scorpius]

- Bug fix: Language support now works for all operating systems, regardless 
  if the file path has an underscore. [Scorpius]

- Added X export plugin.
  [contributed by Ed Kolis (Ekolis)]

- New command in tools menu: "Put on Ground." It simply moves the selected
  objects vertically until they rest on the ground plane. [Scorpius]

- Added "Purple Tube" interface icons. Check the User Interface preference
  tab to switch between icon sets. [Scorpius]

- New commands in 'Select->By' menu: "Fewest Edges Path" selects a path
  (between any two selected vertices) with the fewest number of edges.
  "Shortest Path" selects a path with the shortest distance. If more than one
  possible solution exists, the first one found will be selected. [Scorpius]

- New secondary mode for dissolve, called clean dissolve.
  [contributed by Richard Jones (Optigon)]

--- 0.98.35 -----------------------------------------------------------------

- Move absolute now works for lights. [Giniu]

- Added very basic version of absolute scale, it would be extended 
  after feedback. [Giniu]

- Both absolute scale and move is now placed in one menu group,
  in absolute commands. [Giniu]

- New absolute tool was added - snap - it is similar to move but
  works with secondary selection. There two snap modes, quick LMB and
  full RMB. Simple weld was eaten by quick version of snap. [Giniu]

- Fixed bug in View -> Align to Selection. [Giniu]

- Turn Edge plugin now have option dialog to choose between clasic 
  turn method, clockwise rotate and counterclockwise rotate. [Giniu]

- An improved modelling lighting for people with newer gfx cards,
  select 'one light' [Dgud]

- Improved rotate command again when using constraints [Dgud]

- Change the automatic chart rotation again in autouv [Dgud]

- Hopefully fixed the unfold issue from inside the autouv window [Dgud]

- New selection method: by sharp edges.
  [contributed by Anthony D'Agostino (Scorpius)]

- Polish translation fixes.
  [contributed by Maciej Milewski]

- Minor corrections for Mac and Windows to work with R11B and newest
  SDL and esdl. For Mac, Mac OS 10.4 or higher ("Tiger") is now required.
  (Unless you build from source yourself.) Sorry for that. [bjorng]

--- 0.98.34 -----------------------------------------------------------------

- Minor autouv fixes.

- Fixed stored selection bug reported by LoTekK.

- Added a loop cut mode to (tools) connect tool.

- Fixed very small bug in vertex weld (troubles with undo).

- Added second vertex weld mode for those who prefers just moving vertices 
  to target position and then clean mesh (it's under RMB click on "Weld").
  
- Totally rewrote absolute move so now is works for any selection mode, 
  and is able to align, move whole objects and create multiple duplicates of object.
  [Giniu]

- Should now hopefully work on Mac OS 10.3.9 ("Panther").
  Erlang/OTP updated to R10B-10, which has a fix for a rare
  start-up problem. [Bjorn]

--- 0.98.33 -----------------------------------------------------------------

- Dan fixed (hopefully finally) the Rotate commands speed so they work as before.

- Dan fixed rotate in vertex mode so it centers around all selected vertices.

- Giniu made all active (compilable) plug-ins translatable and translated them to Polish 
  (the toxic and yafray plugins still needs to be translated, but are translatable).

- Giniu added 4 selection methods: select by vertices with 6 or more edges,
  select by non quadrangle faces (all faces, faces with odd or even number of edges).
  
- Giniu added two new tools - "move->absolute" for positioning in absolute 
  coordinates and "weld" for welding single vertex to other one.

- DesiredUserName/MicrobeSoft implemented pick-up and drop images in outliner.

- Syndarion updated the French translation.

- AUTOUV changes (Dan): 
  - In face mode added a combined project from normal and unfolding command.
  - In segmenting mode, when uv-mapping failes the good charts gets uv-mapped and
    the failed charts stays in the segmenting window.
  - MMB on uv-mapping, finds and marks the old chart cuts.
  - Repeat implemented.
  - Other minor stuff, uv-grid and changed material/image handling.
  - Re-written the texture image creator, move images with your uv's or 
    use it to draw vertex color or materials it can also use opengl shaders.

- Programmers: 
  Update to the latest erlang release. (png requires it)
  Both the #we and #st have a new field pst (plugin state)
    That requires a re-compilation of most (all?) of the external plugins.
    Plugins that use the pst field should export two functions: 
       PLUGIN:merge_we([We1,We2..]) and PLUGIN:merge_st(NewData,OldSt) both should
       return the new data of the plugin.

--- 0.98.32b -----------------------------------------------------------------

- Giniu made AutoUV and almost all other plug-ins translatable and
  translated them to Polish.

- Import, especially 3DS import, improved.

- Dan G fixed crash in the Connect tool. (Problem reported by Fonte Boa.)

- The Image creation command now correctly create images
  with size which are not multiples of 8 or 16.

- Dan G made sure wings files containing bad images created by previous
  versions of Wings can now be loaded, but with the faulty images
  missing. (Problem reported by Hanzaa.)

- Dan G fixed file open problem reported by Bob19971.

- The length and color of normals shown by View|Show Normals can now
  be changed in the preferences. (By Giniu.)

- Dmitry Efremov has updated the hlines plug-in.

- Changed toxic to render png instead of tga. (By Dan G.)

- Dan G fixed the Rotate commands speed so they work as before.

- Raimo added an option for loading rendered image into
  internal viewer independent from external viewer option.

AutoUV (by Dan G):

- New commands in edge mode: slide, distribute evenly.

- New commands in object mode:Normalize Chart sizes.

- The Scale and Rotate commands now have magnets.


For developers:

- New function e3d_mesh:make_polygons/1. e3d_mesh:make_quads/1 changed back
  to only make quads.
